## Joshua's profile page 🥳

I am an assistant professor at the [Open Universiteit](https://www.ou.nl/)

I have started to move some of my personal repositories away from GitHub.
You'll find them on my own forgejo instance, the link can be found on my
[personal website ✅](https://joshuamoerman.nl).
I have a [Codeberg profile ⛰](https://codeberg.org/Jaxan) also.
